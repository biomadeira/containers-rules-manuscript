## Introduction

The ability to reproduce the original results of a scientific discovery has been one of the mayor challenges
in modern science. Evidences from multiple authors suggest that reproducibility in biomedical research is lower than 85% [PMID: 24411643], while 90% of researchers agree in a reproducibility crisis [PMID: 27225100]. One of the major drawbacks is to be able to reproduce the bioinformatics analysis, including the data processing and statistical downstream analysis [PMID: 24204232]. Most of the authors that study this problem, has been focussed in the openness of the tools, softwares, scripts and data to perform the bioinformatics analysis [PMID: 24204232, 27415786]. However, even if source code and data are published in a public repository (e.g Github) alongside the paper as open source artifacts, they come with many dependencies, configurations, versions that make their use hard to achieve [DOI:10.1145/2723872.2723882]. The build, installation and reproduction of bioinformatics results often requires internal knowledge that is missing from the published manuscript.
